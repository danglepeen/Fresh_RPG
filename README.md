I came here by my own free will... Or so I thought. However......To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself....There is a part of me that I don't understand. That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth. If you hadn't stopped me, Aerith might have been......There's something inside of me. A person who is not really me. That's why I should quit this journey. Before I do something terrible... But I am going... he destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed Aerith and is now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive... Sephiroth. I... I must go on.
